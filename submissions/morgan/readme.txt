# Project0

## Collaboration
I worked on Parts 1-5 and a few of the Bells ("Tooltips" and "Best Fit Lines") with Sam Molnar. By myself, I've written up this readme.txt and implemented the "Styling your Visualization" Bell and the "Transitions", "Coordinated Views", and "Replication" Whistles.

## Project Specifications

### Parts 1-5: Interpreting Data, Building Bars, Building Scatterplots, Interaction, Building Multiple Charts

Mostly, relied on the in-class example to get these parts done. I did glance at [this](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/) to get started with my bar chart.

## Bells & Whistles:

### Bells: Tooltips, Styling your Visualization, Best Fit Lines

For the "Styling your Visualization" Bell, I drew inspiration from Vincent Van Gogh's ["The Starry Night"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night). I used an [online tool](http://palettegenerator.com/) to generate a color palette from the painting and selected a few of the most distinct colors (i.e. blue, green, and black).

I refreshed my memory of how to calculate the [line of best fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression#Fitting_the_regression_line).

### Whistles: Transitions, Coordinated Views, Replication

I looked at [this D3 example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5872848) to figure out a drop down menu. I referred to the in-class example for transitioning points between plots.

I used Google Sheets as my WYSIWYG tool for the "Replication" whistle. Screenshots are provided in the `replication` folder, as well as the document is visible here: https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/spreadsheets/d/1kN-cNlsJ61Lwhh95oTRaJR-O-YGq5Ip2jy9fe27oi78/edit?usp=sharing. I noticed how much harder it was to customize the plots I made in Google Sheets versus D3; after much Googling, I learned that there were some features that were flat-out impossible to do (i.e. dashed lines, thicker axes, custom colors).
