# Project0

## Collaboration
I worked on Parts 1-5 and a few of the Bells ("Tooltips" and "Best Fit Lines") with Sam Molnar. By myself, I've written up this readme.txt and implemented the "Styling your Visualization" Bell and the "Transitions", "Coordinated Views", and "Replication" Whistle.

## Project Specifications

### Parts 1-5: Interpreting Data, Building Bars, Building Scatterplots, Interaction, Building Multiple Charts

> TODO: If you use code from any online sources, please also list those sources and what pieces of the code you used those sources to complete.

## Bells & Whistles:

### Bells: Tooltips, Styling your Visualization, Best Fit Lines

For the "Styling your Visualization" Bell, I drew inspiration from Vincent Van Gogh's ["The Starry Night"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night). I used an [online tool](http://palettegenerator.com/) to generate a color palette from the painting and selected a few of the most distinct colors (i.e. blue, green, and black).

### Whistles: Transitions, Coordinated Views, Replication

I used Google Sheets as my WYSIWYG tool for the "Replication" whistle. Screenshots are provided in the `replication` folder, as well as the document is visible here: https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/spreadsheets/d/1kN-cNlsJ61Lwhh95oTRaJR-O-YGq5Ip2jy9fe27oi78/edit?usp=sharing

> TODO: In your readme.txt, outline how you created each visualization in the WYSIWYG system and what differences you experienced in assembling that visualization.
